** 1. Ranking web pages using various algorithms, including PageRank and HITS **
Page Ranking: The Process of Ordering web pages according to their importance and relevance to the desired search. All search engines use page ranking, with Google being the prime example, utilizing web graphs for page ranking. In this project, we delved into page ranking using algorithms such as PageRank and HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) to rank web pages.

2. Analysis of Recurring Patterns in Customer Shopping Using Apriori and FP-Growth
Exploring methods for analyzing recurring patterns in customer shopping carts was the primary objective of this project. The goal was to extract frequent items and identify combinations of products frequently purchased together. To achieve this, algorithms such as Apriori and FP_Growth were employed.

3. Exploring Data Mining Algorithms for Detecting Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions
An examination of various data mining algorithms for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions was conducted in this project. The objective was to identify fraudulent transactions within a dataset spanning multiple days. To achieve this, algorithms like Isolation Forest, Random Forest, and Decision Tree were employed to detect outliers in the data.

5. Clustered Health News: Analyzing Twitter Data for Insights and Discovering Trends in Healthcare
During the investigation of the Health News in Twitter Dataset, several clustering algorithms were utilized, such as k-means, Spectral Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN. The appropriate number of clusters was determined using the Elbow and Silhouette methods. PCA and t-SNE techniques were employed for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.

6.Exploring Feature Selection Methods on Diabetes Dataset
In this project, we analyzed and examined various feature selection methods, including filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods, on the diabetes dataset.
